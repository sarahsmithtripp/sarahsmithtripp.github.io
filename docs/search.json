To investigate the relationship between disturbed forest canopies and climate I measured canopy height using a remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) and monitored microclimate with low-cost temperature and soil moisture sensors. I found growing season temperatures at -8 cm (soil), 0 cm (surface), and 15 cm (near-surface) relative to the ground surface were higher under shorter more disturbed canopies. Soil temperature was most sensitive to canopy height differences: linear models for the observed data range predicted a 2.0 °C increase in mean growing season soil temperature with every 10 m decrease in canopy height. There was observed a weak negative relationship between canopy height and mean growing season soil moisture. Importantly, we show canopy height summarized at moderate resolution (15 m) better explained differences in temperature in our disturbed landscape. This work informs future methods to produce gridded microclimate datasets and outlines the impact of disturbed forest structure on microclimate variables. Our results show that the characteristics of the forest canopy remaining after a burn impact microclimates, which has important implications for post-fire ecosystems.\n\n\n\nOrthoimagery of the my Masters Field Set-up Including the 90 Microclimate Loggers"

There are definitely some areas of concern!\n\n\nQuestion 2\nGlobal landcover datasets can have variable accuracy at a local level. Additionally, this landcover dataset is from 2021. Identify three locations on the map below that you think the landcover dataset is “missing” for each location, note the type of building (residential, commercial, industrial) and the distance to the nearest set of trees. You might notice that some areas actually already burned! For these areas, you can estimate the location of the structure and the distance to the nearest forested area.\nYou can use the map to measure distance by clicking on the line feature at the left of the map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrioritizing Neighbourhoods\nUsing our knowledge of which built up areas in West Kelowna are the closests to different forested areas we will now sum the total area at risk for each neighborhood of West Kelowna. We can access the neighbourhoods of Kelowna from the city’s open GIS portal here\nFor each neighbourhood we calculated the total land area that is forest within 30 m of a built up area. Use the map below to answer the question.\n\n\nQuestion 3\nWhich neighbourhoods of West Kelowna does our map suggest to prioritize for more firesmart landscaping initiatives?
