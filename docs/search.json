To investigate the relationship between disturbed forest canopies and climate I measured canopy height using a remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) and monitored microclimate with low-cost temperature and soil moisture sensors. I found growing season temperatures at -8 cm (soil), 0 cm (surface), and 15 cm (near-surface) relative to the ground surface were higher under shorter more disturbed canopies. Soil temperature was most sensitive to canopy height differences: linear models for the observed data range predicted a 2.0 °C increase in mean growing season soil temperature with every 10 m decrease in canopy height. There was observed a weak negative relationship between canopy height and mean growing season soil moisture. Importantly, we show canopy height summarized at moderate resolution (15 m) better explained differences in temperature in our disturbed landscape. This work informs future methods to produce gridded microclimate datasets and outlines the impact of disturbed forest structure on microclimate variables. Our results show that the characteristics of the forest canopy remaining after a burn impact microclimates, which has important implications for post-fire ecosystems.\n\n\n\nOrthoimagery of the my Masters Field Set-up Including the 90 Microclimate Loggers"

There are definitely some areas of concern!\n\n\nQuestion 2\nGlobal landcover datasets can have variable accuracy at a local level. Additionally, this landcover dataset is from 2021. Identify three locations on the map below that you think the landcover dataset is “missing” for each location, note the type of building (residential, commercial, industrial) and the distance to the nearest set of trees. You might notice that some areas actually already burned! For these areas, you can estimate the location of the structure and the distance to the nearest forested area.\nYou can use the map to measure distance by clicking on the line feature at the left of the map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrioritizing Neighbourhoods\nUsing our knowledge of which built up areas in West Kelowna are the closests to different forested areas we will now sum the total area at risk for each neighborhood of West Kelowna. We can access the neighbourhoods of Kelowna from the city’s open GIS portal here\nFor each neighbourhood we calculated the total land area that is forest within 30 m of a built up area. Use the map below to answer the question.\n\n\nQuestion 3\nWhich neighbourhoods of West Kelowna does our map suggest to prioritize for more firesmart landscaping initiatives?

They bring people from all different locations that work in fire to the same spot to do managed fire when it is possible to do managed fire. Alongside getting more fire on the landscape, they also support knowledge exchanges between fire practitioners. In so doing we can learn the many ways fire can better our land management. In this post I am going to talk about the value of prescribed burning and forest fuel management, the management methods, and finally the value of cross-boundary relationships for achieving management goals."

    "text": "Developing Wildfire Disaster Resilience through Mitigation\n\nPrescribed Fire Definitions\nPrescribed fire is a fire that purposely planned and managed for on a landscape. The purpose of a fire prescription can include:\n\nFuel reduction\nAgriculture and timber management\nEcosystem health and restoration\n\nIt is important to recognize that our forest ecosystems evolved with fire. Further, fire is part of historic western North American land management. Indigenous have integrated fire as part of land stewardship for millenia. The US government started to realize the need and benefits of wildfire on the landscape in 2009, and supported large-scale implementation of prescription and research under the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program authorized by the 2009 Omnibus Public Lands Management Act. This grant provided $40,000,000 2009 through 2019 to fund thinning and prescription across the US. The benefits of this investment are just beginning to be realized.\n\n\nImpact of Prescriptions\nPrescription burning, mechanical thinning with prescription burning, and mechanical thinning all reduce severity of subsequent wildfire. In a 2024 meta-analysis of 40 studies across the US, they found the overall effect of prescription decreased severity by 62-72%. The most effective is a combination of thinning and prescription burning Davis et al., 2025.\nThe State of Oregon and individual counties capitalized on the fuel management funding of the late 2000s to support large-scale mechanical thinning operation and the development of cohesive burn plans. A particularly successful case-studies from the statewide forest fuel management investment is the Deschutes Collaborative Forest Project treatments in Sisters, Oregon. In this case, fuel management followed by prescribed burning helped wildland firefighters protect Sisters from the 2017 Fire - another fire that burned at incredibly high-intensity."

It was an awesome experience to read through the “burn plans” to understand how a burn manager would approach meeting “burn objectives” such as reducing the number of shrubs or the amount of dry litter on the ground.\nBefore every burn you do a “test fire” which checks to make sure that the fuel, moisture, and weather conditions will allow you to burn to meet objectives. In some cases, our test fire meant that we stopped the fire for the day and transitioned to “mop up.” During mop up we put in containment lines around the fire, put out some of the larger flames, monitored the fire to make sure it did not move.\nIf the test fire was successful we proceeded to burn the rest of the block. During the burn, you adjust the spacing of people and fuel addition so that you can control the fire intensity. Burning often took the entire morning, but afterwards everyone would be put on “holding” where you active held the fire and started to “mop up” again.

Planning a prescription can take decades, and even once a plan is developed it can take years for the right people and the right conditions to accomplish a burn.
