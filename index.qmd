## Passionate about Cultivating Resilient Communities

I am an interdisciplinary ecosystem scientist interested in risk and resilience research. My PhD uses remote-sensing techniques, including satellite imagery and lidar (light detection and ranging) to model forest recovery (or lack of recovery) after large and high severity wildfire. In my work, I aim to provide decision makers with accessible and accurate tools so they can take proactive steps to protect people and forests. Starting in summer 2025, I am seeking a position working in risk and resilience research in academic, private, and governmental spaces. In particular, I want to work on research that prioritizes community disaster resilience, leveraging joint problem framing to highlight community needs.

I am passionate about collaborative research and enthusiastic about science communication. Some of my most gratifying work has been restarting the UBC graduate student Wildfire Discussion Group and presenting to US Senator Merkeley's staff on the importance of systemic disaster resilience. Please reach out if you are interested in talks or demonstrations on drones, satellite science, or community resilience and response to disaster.
