## Hello 2025

It's been a long-time since the #ScantiquesRoadshow blog updates of 2022. In the time being, I've developed new collaborations and passions - all peppered in with more drone flights. As I roll out my new website I want to give a special thank you to the personal website page and post by Louse Sinks. [Checkout their webpage here - it's really inspiring!](https://lsinks.github.io/posts/2023-11-01-website-building/website.html).

2024 was a year for **collaborative science, finding my voice, and realizing my greatests strengths is connecting the right people and the right ideas.** As I move into 2025, I want to write up some thoughts on these experiences - so stay tuned for thoughts on:

1.  My time as a guest student at ETH Zurich [as a member of the Forest Research Group](https://form.ethz.ch/the-group.html)
2.   Revamping the UBC Wildfire Discussion Group [see a description of the page and join the email list here](https://sarahsmithtripp.github.io/WildfireDiscussionGroup.html)
